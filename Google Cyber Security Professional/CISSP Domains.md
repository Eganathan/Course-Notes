# CISSP Eight Domains and IAM Components

## 1. Security and Risk Management
  defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.

## 2. Asset Security
  The asset security domain is focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data
  This means that assets such as PII or SPII should be securely handled and protected, whether stored on a computer, transferred over a network like the internet, or even physically collected. Organizations also need to have policies and procedures that ensure data is properly stored, maintained, retained, and destroyed.

## 3. Security Architecture and engineering
  Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

## 4. Communication and Network Security
  Focused on managing and securing physical network and wireless communication.

## 5. IAM (Identity and access management)
  Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.
      ### Components of IAM
        1. Identification : (username, access card, fingerprint, etc which is a reference to their identity)
        2. Authentication: (is a process of proving their identity like password or pin)
        3. Authorization : (this process is taking place after the identity has been confirmed, which grants a level of access as per the standards of the company)
        4. Accountability: (is a process of monitoring and recording user actions logging the activities such as login attempts and  data accesss)

## 6. Security Assessment and Testing
   Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. 

## 7. Security Operations
